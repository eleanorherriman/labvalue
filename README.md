# labvalue
Repository of evidence-based laboratory and pathology use cases that generate value - papers, algorithms, CDS, tools, economics
Based on past 10 years of work, including analysis of Prometheus payment system for reduction in PACs using advanced lab services and clinical informatics systems such as decision support, I would like to propose a project that publicizes these opportunities for value generation.   This project would be an open-source style development to first determine the process and "product" for this public database.
